    <h3>Patterns & Insights</h3>
    <p>
      Discover Hidden Patterns & Insights. Uncover correlations, clusters, or
      latent variables in customer behavior, operations, or markets that would
      be invisible through manual analysis.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Threats, Anomalies & Risks</h3>
    <p>
      Detect Threats, Anomalies & Risks. Spot fraud, compliance breaches,
      cybersecurity threats, or operational anomalies and vulnerabilities using
      real-time or retrospective detection techniques (e.g. HMMs, RNNs, graph
      analysis).
    </p>
    <p>
      You've heard stories of businesses and councils being invaded by
      attackers? Improve your security.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm not a DevSecOps operatice, but I can advise, point you at people who
      are, and be your interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>OSINT, threat detection, may course, etc.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Trends & Forecasts</h3>
    <p>
      Identify Trends & Forecasts. Use time-series and predictive modeling with
      confidence to forecast demand, revenue, churn, supply chain disruptions,
      or market shifts — turning past data into foresight.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Hidden Opportunities</h3>
    <p>
      Surface Strategic Opportunities. Reveal underutilized assets, untapped
      customer segments, cross-sell potentials, or expansion markets using
      segmentation, RFM analysis, or entity-linking.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Automate Repetitive & Manual Processes</h3>
    <p>
      Build ML-powered workflows (e.g. document classification, image/video
      tagging, intelligent routing, summarisation) to reduce cost and free up
      staff time and minimise drudgery.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Enhance Decision-Making with AI</h3>
    <p>
      Provide AI-assisted decision tools (e.g. scoring models, dashboards,
      counterfactuals) to improve accuracy and confidence in high-stakes
      decisions.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Link Data & Build Knowledge Graphs</h3>
    <p>
      Integrate scattered records across silos, resolve duplicates, and create
      rich, queryable maps of people, places, organisations, and their
      relationships.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Strengthen Compliance & Governance</h3>
    <p>
      Monitor for regulatory breaches, automate audit trails, and implement data
      quality and lineage frameworks — ensuring data is a safe asset, not a
      liability.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Turn Unstructured Text into Insights</h3>
    <p>
      Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to mine emails, reports, reviews, or
      social data for sentiment, intent, named entities, and signals — giving
      voice to messy data.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Build Visual, Intuitive Intelligence Tools</h3>
    <p>
      Deliver dashboards, apps, or storyboards (e.g. in NiceGUI, Dash,
      Streamlit) that empower non-technical users to explore and act on data in
      real-time.
