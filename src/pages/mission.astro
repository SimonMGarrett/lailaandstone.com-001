      <h2 class="!mt-12">Statement</h2>
      <p>
        At LAILA+STONE, we believe that every dataset—no matter how messy—is a story
        waiting to be told. Our mission is to partner with forward-thinking
        organisations to uncover clarity in chaos, transforming tangled,
        inconsistent, and incomplete data into clean, connected, and actionable
        insight.
      </p>
      <p>
        We approach each challenge with curiosity and care, supporting our clients
        with a blend of deep technical expertise and genuine collaboration. Whether
        you're untangling legacy systems, consolidating scattered silos, or
        searching for hidden patterns that drive strategic advantage, we’re here to
        help you navigate the noise with confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are committed to your success. With us, data becomes more than just
        information—it becomes a trusted asset, a competitive edge, and a catalyst
        for smarter decisions.
      </p>
    
      <h2 class="!mt-12">Core Principles</h2>
    
      <ul class="!mb-24">
        <li>
          <h3>Clarity over complexity</h3>
          <p>
            We make data science understandable. You should be able to <em>trust</em
            > the results, <em>interpret</em> them easily, and <em>act</em> on them confidently.
            We bridge the gap between raw, abstract data and real business decisions
            — empowering you with insights, not jargon &mdash; Data science should reveal,
            not obscure.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Bespoke, human-centred approach</h3>
          <p>
            No two clients are the same. Tools, dashboards, and models are always
            built with your users in mind — intuitive, usable, and designed for
            real-world needs.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Impact-driven</h3>
          <p>
            Every project should have a purpose: solving real problems, reducing
            risks, and creating lasting value.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Rigour and craftsmanship</h3>
          <p>
            We bring a scientific mindset and careful design to everything we do —
            grounded in statistics, tested thoroughly, and built to last.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Respect for data</h3>
          <p>
            Data is an asset. We treat it that way — with strong governance,
            transparency, and stewardship from start to finish.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Navigating AI responsibly</h3>
          <p>
            We help clients adopt AI with confidence — avoiding hype, managing risk,
            and building trust in every step.
          </p>
