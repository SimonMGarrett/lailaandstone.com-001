  <h2>Exploration</h2>
  <p class="lead-para">
    Your data is trying to tell you something. Our mission is to help you hear
    it.
  </p>
  <p>
    Whether you're sitting on a flocak of spreadsheets, seasoned databases, a
    warehouse full of logs, or years of reports and emails — there's hidden
    value waiting to be found.
  </p>
  <p>
    We use modern AI, machine learning, and data science to surface what
    matters: insights you didn't know existed, threats before they escalate, and
    opportunities hiding in the data weeds.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you've ever wondered, <em
      >"What could we learn from our data if we really looked?"</em
    > — now's the time to find out.
  </p>

  <h2>Value</h2>
  <p class="lead-para">
    You want a return on your investment. That's not just good business — it's
    common sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everything we do is guided by your goals. Whether it's unlocking insights,
    solving persistent problems, or removing friction, we focus on what matters
    to <em>you</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Right now, "we" means just me — and that's fine. Because what really matters
    is the conversation: understanding your challenges, and working together to
    solve the data and tech bottlenecks holding you back.
  </p>
  <p>
    We specialise in surfacing what's not obvious — subtle patterns, threats,
    trends, and opportunities hidden in messy or complex data.
  </p>
  <p>
    I bring the same joy to untangling your problems as an accountant does to a
    perfect spreadsheet — or an artist to a blank canvas.
  </p>

  <h2>Compliance & Security</h2>
  <p class="lead-para">
    Staying safe and staying legal aren't optional — and we treat them with the
    care they deserve.
  </p>
  <p>
    From protecting sensitive information to aligning with regulatory
    frameworks, we bring experience to help you manage data securely and
    responsibly.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em
      >Note: we're not legal advisors — just experienced professionals who care
      about doing things right.</em

  ...danger, our principles and theirs

  <h2>Core Principles</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <h3>Clarity over complexity</h3>
      <p>
        We make data science understandable. You should be able to <em>trust</em
        > the results, <em>interpret</em> them easily, and <em>act</em> on them confidently.
        We bridge the gap between raw, abstract data and real business decisions
        — empowering you with insights, not jargon &mdash; Data science should reveal,
        not obscure.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Bespoke, human-centred approach</h3>
      <p>
        No two clients are the same. Tools, dashboards, and models are always
        built with your users in mind — intuitive, usable, and designed for
        real-world needs.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Impact-driven</h3>
      <p>
        Every project should have a purpose: solving real problems, reducing
        risks, and creating lasting value.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Rigour and craftsmanship</h3>
      <p>
        We bring a scientific mindset and careful design to everything we do —
        grounded in statistics, tested thoroughly, and built to last.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Respect for data</h3>
      <p>
        Data is an asset. We treat it that way — with strong governance,
        transparency, and stewardship from start to finish.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Navigating AI responsibly</h3>
      <p>
        We help clients adopt AI with confidence — avoiding hype, managing risk,
        and building trust in every step.
      </p>
    </li>
