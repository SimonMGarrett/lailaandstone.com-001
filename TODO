- [x] Add ICONS to sidebar menu.
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle?
- [ ] Test the Contact page works live (may need to change the domain in Form and certainly need to do something about the submit URL which currently does not exist.)
- [ ] Check the `Outfit` font loads nicely, not jankily, where the font is not installed on the device.
- [ ] Do the legal pages, and something that states I'm not giving advise on sec or anything else outside my domain.
- [ ] Ensure all pages have two- or three-pane layouts
- [ ] The homepage images should visually take the user from a mass of data to something more refined, to something actionable. So, maybe a dashboard at the end?
- [ ] The existing images should be used elsewhere, perhaps in MISSION.
